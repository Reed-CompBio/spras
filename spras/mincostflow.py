"""
MinCostFlow deals with fully directed graphs
- OR Tools MCF is designed for directed graphs
- when an edge (arc) is added, it has a source and target node, so flow is only allowed to move from source to the target
However, its the directionality it assigns to undirected edges via the flow assignments is not meaningful, so all
edges are currently undirected.

Expected raw input format:
Interactor1  Interactor2   Weight
- the expected raw input file should have node pairs in the 1st and 2nd columns, with the weight in the 3rd column
- it can include repeated and bidirectional edges
