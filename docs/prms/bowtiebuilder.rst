BowTieBuilder
==========

BowTieBuilder is a pathway reconstruction algorithm which constructs pathways in a 'bowtie'-like
fasion, finding the intersections of shortests paths between sources and targets and using those nodes as a basis
for generating a new reconstructed network.

BowTieBuilder does not take in any arguments.
