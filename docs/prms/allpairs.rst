=========

All Pairs Shortest Paths is an algorithm which, given a weighed interactome,
will return the induced edge subnetwork of the interactome consisting
of all of the shortest paths from every single source to every single product
with respect to a cartesian product.

All Pairs does not take any arguments. Its source code is at https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/all-pairs-shortest-paths
