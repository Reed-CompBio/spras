PathLinker
==========

PathLinker is a pathway reconstruction algorithm which adapts the k-shortest paths problem
(implemented with Yen's algorithm) to a pathway reconstruction context. See the source code:
https://github.com/Murali-group/PathLinker, or the associated papers: https://www.nature.com/articles/npjsba20162 and
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23641868/.

PathLinker takes one optional argument:

* k: The number of paths to find (*k* shortest paths).
