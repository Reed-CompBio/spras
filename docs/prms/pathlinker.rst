PathLinker
==========

PathLinker is a pathway reconstruction algorithm which adapts the k-shortest paths problem
(implemented with Yen's algorithm) to a pathway reconstruction context. See the source code:
https://github.com/Murali-group/PathLinker, or the associated papers: https://doi.org/10.1038/npjsba.2016.2 and
https://doi.org/10.1089/cmb.2012.0274.

PathLinker takes one optional argument:

* k: The number of paths to find (*k* shortest paths).
