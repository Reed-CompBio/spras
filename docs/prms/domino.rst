DOMINO
======

DOMINO is an AMI algorithm (which is broadly categorized in SPRAS under the DMMM label). See the associated paper: https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20209593
and the associated MIT-licensed codebase: https://github.com/Shamir-Lab/DOMINO/.

DOMINO has two optional parameters:

* slice_threshold: the p-value threshold for considering a slice as relevant
* module_threshold: the p-value threshold for considering a putative module as final module
