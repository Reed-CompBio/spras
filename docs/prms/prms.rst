Pathway Reconstruction Methods
=====================================

.. note::
   While every algorithm here is broadly labelled as a pathway reconstruction method,
   there are other sub-types of algorithms that have more specialized capabilities than the rest.
   Currently, SPRAS also supports edge orientation algorithms (e.g. MEO) and AMIs/DMMMs (e.g. DOMINO).
