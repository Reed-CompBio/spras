TieDIE
======

TieDIE is a pathway reconstruction algorithm which TODO.
See the `original paper <https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt471>`_ and SPRAS's fork of the codebase:
https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/TieDIE.

TieDIE takes several optional parameters:

* s: (int, default 1) Network size control factor
* d_expr: List of significantly differentially expressed genes, along with log-FC or FC values (i.e. by edgeR for RNA-Seq or SAM for microarray data. Generated by a sample-dichotomy of interest.)
* a: (int) Linker Cutoff (overrides the Size factor)
* c: (int, default 3) Search depth for causal paths
* p: (int, default 1000) Number of random permutations performed for significance analysis
* pagerank: (boolean, default false) uses PageRank for diffusion
* all_paths: (boolean, default false) Use all paths instead of only causal paths
