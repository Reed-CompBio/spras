My current plan for my COMBINE 25 tutorial (that will then be used for the spras doc tutorials)
- I will be testing this on a user that has basic python knowledge but doesn't know spras

*Tony will be giving a presentation on PRAs and SPRAS prior (hopefully) to this tutorial

0) 
- need to preinstall conda, docker, vscode(?) (or run on terminal), git, and cytoscape prior
    - a few minimum dependencies like Docker and conda and git installed already, the rest are optional but recommended
- Basic Python knowledge (running scripts, installing packages)
- Some basic biology knowledge: what is a protein, a protein interaction etc
Overview of PRAs (Pathway Reconstruction Algorithms) in plain language
What SPRAS is and what problems it solves

1) basic
Goal: Get new users comfortable installing SPRAS
Goal: Run SPRAS with one algorthm on a small example dataset, then re-run it with three different parameter settings to see how network structure changes.

Slides and/or Information to add to docs directly:
Installation & environment setup (Docker Anaconda and Cytoscpare locally)
SPRAS directory structure for a user & configuration files
- config folder
- input folder
- output folder
    - can control the creation of subfolders of outputs in the config file
    - might need to be in a seperate step/slide
Running SPRAS on a provided example dataset 
- set up one algortihm and run
- then run one algortihm with 3 different preset parameter settings
Understanding the outputs
- show the output and structure
- show it visulized
Viewing logs and monitoring runs

Things to make:
- need one small dataset to run on (either make a dummy one or just use egfr)
    - Building around EGFR will be the least amount of work, and that pathway may be a good fit for the COMBINE audience
- basic-config

2) medium
Goal: Run SPRAS with a couple more algorthm with many parameter settings on a smaller and larger example dataset to see how network structure changes.
Goal: Use more of the post analysis tools
- summary stats
- ML

Slides and/or Information to add to docs directly:
For the larger dataset, teach a user how to turn data into the input structure we require
- Formatting prize/source/target files and interactome files & explaining biological meaning
Adding multiple PRAs to the workflow 
- preset parameters
Use/Show summary stats and ML code
- will be useful for parameter tuning (the next tutorial)


Things to make:
- medium-config
- need raw data to make the larger example
    - can use panther pathways


3) hard
Goal: Run SPRAS with all algortihms with larger example dataset to create reproducible benchmarking experiments using gold standard data.
Goal: use evaluation code
Goal: learn how to parameter tune

Slides and/or Information to add to docs directly:
Configure the config file with larger dataset
- set all Algorithms datasets, gold standards
Explain parameter tuning
Teach parameter tuning
- Define coarse parameter spaces and define hueristics
- Define fine parameter spaces after and hueristics
- repeat
- show how to use past post analysis tools help with finding parameters

(maybe I show an example of this rather than doing it in a way the tutorial people do it)
(then people can copy and paste it in and experience it?)

Explain parameter selection
Use the evaluation code and understanding the outputs
- Per-pathway precision and recall plots / pca chosen and pr curves for ensemble
- Where PCA-based chosen params land vs the full grid
Agreement/disagreement between algorithms (heatmaps) using ML

Things to make:
- hard-config
- make a hard-config with tuned parameters to provide after people attempt tuning


Stuff I need to figure out:
# test these tutorials for mac and windows user
