About SPRAS
============

SPRAS, short for "Signalling Pathway Reconstruction Streamliner Analysis" is a work-in-progress dockerized library
of pathway reconstruction enhancement tools. The framework will contain different pathway reconstruction algorithms
that connect genes and proteins of interest in the context of a general protein-protein interaction network, allowing
users to run multiple algorithms on their inputs. See the GLBIO 2021 `slides`_ or `video`_ for more information.
