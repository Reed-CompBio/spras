* Simplified algorithm

A graph with four nodes  $A, B, C, D$ and three equally weighted edges $B \rightarrow A, C \rightarrow A, D \rightarrow A$. Assume the probabilitty distribution between 0 and 1, so the initial value for each page is 0.25 - 25% of the chance a node will be selected. (Consider the values for the input of SPRAS, each node has a weight between -1 and 1, how do we normailize it? How does it relate with the source set?)

Pagerank can be computed iteratively and algebraically.
