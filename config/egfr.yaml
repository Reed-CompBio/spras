# Specify the container framework used by each PRM wrapper. Valid options include:
# - docker (default if not specified)
# - singularity -- Also known as apptainer, useful in HPC/HTC environments where docker isn't allowed
# - dsub -- experimental with limited support, used for running on Google Cloud
container_framework: docker

# Only used if container_framework is set to singularity, this will unpack the singularity containers
# to the local filesystem. This is useful when PRM containers need to run inside another container,
# such as would be the case in an HTCondor/OSPool environment.
# NOTE: This unpacks singularity containers to the local filesystem, which will take up space in a way
# that persists after the workflow is complete. To clean up the unpacked containers, the user must
# manually delete them.

# Allow the user to configure which container registry containers should be pulled from
# Note that this assumes container names are consistent across registries, and that the
# registry being passed doesn't require authentication for pull actions

  # The owner or project of the registry
  # For example, "reedcompbio" if the image is available as docker.io/reedcompbio/allpairs
