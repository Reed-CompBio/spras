# This list of algorithms should be generated by a script which checks the filesystem for installs.
# It shouldn't be changed by mere mortals. (alternatively, we could add a path to executable for each algorithm
# in the list to reduce the number of assumptions of the program at the cost of making the config a little more involved)
# Each algorithm has an 'include' parameter. By toggling 'include' to true/false the user can change
# which algorithms are run in a given experiment.
#
# algorithm-specific parameters are embedded in lists so that users can specify multiple. If multiple
# parameters are specified then the algorithm will be run as many times as needed to cover all parameter
# combinations. For instance if we have the following:
# - name: "myAlg"
#   params:
#         include: true
#         a: [1,2]
#         b: [0.5,0.75]
#
# then myAlg will be run on (a=1,b=0.5),(a=1,b=0.75),(a=2,b=0.5), and (a=2,b=0,75). Pretty neat, but be
# careful: too many parameters might make your runs take a long time.
