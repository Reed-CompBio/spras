 #
 # This list of algorithms should be generated by a script which checks the filesystem for installs.
 # It shouldn't be changed by mere mortals. (alternatively, we could add a path to executable for each algorithm
 # in the list to reduce the number of assumptions of the program at the cost of making the config a little more involved)
 # Each algorithm has an 'include' parameter. By toggling 'include' to true/false the user can change
 # which algorithms are run in a given experiment.
 #
 # algorithm-specific parameters are embedded in lists so that users can specify multiple. If multiple
 # parameters are specified then the algorithm will be run as many times as needed to cover all parameter
 # combinations. For instance if we have the following:
 # - name: "myAlg"
 #   params:
 #         include: true
 #         directed: true
 #         a: [1,2]
 #         b: [0.5,0.75]
 #
 # then myAlg will be run on (a=1,b=0.5),(a=1,b=0.75),(a=2,b=0.5), and (a=2,b=0,75). Pretty neat, but be
 # careful: too many parameters might make your runs take a long time.
