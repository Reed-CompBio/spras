Several databases store high-quality representations of these pathways that are amenable for automated analyses. Despite painstaking and manual curation, these databases remain incomplete. We present P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc>, a new computational method to reconstruct the interactions in a signaling pathway of interest. P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc> efficiently computes multiple short paths from the receptors to transcriptional regulators (TRs) in a pathway within a background protein interaction network. We use P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc> to accurately reconstruct a comprehensive set of signaling pathways from the NetPath and KEGG databases. We show that P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc> has higher precision and recall than several state-of-the-art algorithms, while also ensuring that the resulting network connects receptor proteins to TRs. P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc>’s reconstruction of the Wnt pathway identified CFTR, an ABC class chloride ion channel transporter, as a novel intermediary that facilitates the signaling of Ryk to Dab2, which are known components of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In HEK293 cells, we show that the Ryk–CFTR–Dab2 path is a novel amplifier of β-catenin signaling specifically in response to Wnt 1, 2, 3, and 3a of the 11 Wnts tested. P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc> captures the structure of signaling pathways as represented in pathway databases better than existing methods. P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc>’s success in reconstructing pathways from NetPath and KEGG databases point to its applicability for complementing manual curation of these databases. P<jats:sc>ATH</jats:sc>L<jats:sc>INKER</jats:sc> may serve as a promising approach for prioritizing proteins and interactions for experimental study, as illustrated by its discovery of a novel pathway in Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
