# Only used if container_framework is set to singularity, this will unpack the singularity containers
# to the local filesystem. This is useful when PRM containers need to run inside another container,
# such as would be the case in an HTCondor/OSPool environment.
# NOTE: This unpacks singularity containers to the local filesystem, which will take up space in a way
# that persists after the workflow is complete. To clean up the unpacked containers, the user must
# manually delete them.
