containers:
  # Specify the container framework used by each PRM wrapper. Valid options include:
  # - docker (default if not specified)
  # - singularity -- Also known as apptainer, useful in HPC/HTC environments where docker isn't allowed
  # - dsub -- experimental with limited support, used for running on Google Cloud with the All of Us cloud environment.
  #   - There is no support for other environments at the moment.
  framework: docker

  # Only used if container_framework is set to singularity, this will unpack the singularity containers
  # to the local filesystem. This is useful when PRM containers need to run inside another container,
  # such as would be the case in an HTCondor/OSPool environment.
  # NOTE: This unpacks singularity containers to the local filesystem, which will take up space in a way
  # that persists after the workflow is complete. To clean up the unpacked containers, the user must
  # manually delete them. For convenience, these unpacked files will exist in the current working directory
  # under `unpacked`.

  # Allow the user to configure which container registry containers should be pulled from
  # Note that this assumes container names are consistent across registries, and that the
  # registry being passed doesn't require authentication for pull actions
  registry:
    base_url: docker.io
    # The owner or project of the registry
    # For example, "reedcompbio" if the image is available as docker.io/reedcompbio/allpairs
