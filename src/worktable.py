# Goal: Find relevant genes on a background network with high specificity

# Steps:

def tiedie():
    '''
    Input:
    1. A graph G = (V, E) where V represents the set of genes and E represents the set of interactions between genes (undirected in this case).
    2. |V| = N and |E| = I
    3. G is stored as the form of adjacency matrix A = (a_ij) where a_ij = 1 if there is an edge between gene i and gene j, and 0 otherwise.
    4. A set of scores for each gene in V, where the score of gene i is denoted as x_i 
        4.1 We have -1 <= x_i <= 1 to reflect an association of activity with the disease.
        4.2 If not involved in the disease process, x_i = 0.
        4.3 
    5. A new vector of scores y = (y_1, y_2, ..., y_N)
