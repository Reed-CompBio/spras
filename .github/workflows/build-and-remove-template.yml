name: Build and Remove Docker Image
# A workflow template that handles building+removing SPRAS containers.

# Required inputs are:
# - path: The path to a container's Dockerfile directory, relative to the repo root.
# - container: The registry/container to be built, without a tag.
# - always_build: A boolean indicating whether the action should condition the container build
#                 on detected changes.
# - context: The optional build context path, relative to the repo root.
